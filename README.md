Home Assistant integration for **Daze WallBox EV chargers**. Uses [pydaze](https://github.com/mcaimi/pydaze) API integration module to interface with Daze Web Portal.

Daze wallboxes are managed through the [Daze web portal](https://webportal.dazeservice.com). This integration bridges the gap, bringing your wallbox into Home Assistant alongside all your other smart home devices.

## Features

- **Real-time monitoring** — Power (W), delivered energy (Wh), charging current per phase (mA), AC voltage per phase (V), board and case temperatures (°C)
- **EVSE status** — See whether the wallbox is charging, idle, paused, in error, or offline
- **Charge control** — Start and stop charging from HA switches, automations, or dashboards
- **Current limit** — Set the maximum charging current as a number entity (6–32 A, 0.1 A steps)
- **Operation mode** — Switch between eco, fast, and scheduled modes
- **Session history** — Track energy, duration, cost, average power, and charge time per recharge session
- **Lifetime totals** — Total energy delivered and session count
- **Diagnostics** — Grid max power, photovoltaic presence, three-phase supply info, scheduled charges
- **Dual authentication** — Authenticate with email/password (Cognito) or access/refresh tokens
- **State restoration** — Cumulative sensors (energy, sessions) persist across Home Assistant restarts
- **Multiple chargers** — Add multiple EV chargers as separate devices, each with its own set of entities and services
- **Fully UI-driven** — Set up entirely through the Home Assistant UI, no YAML editing required

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to **HACS → Integrations**
3. Click the three dots in the top-right corner and select **Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/mcaimi/daze-addon
   ```

5. Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**
6. Close the dialog — the Daze Wallbox integration should now appear in HACS
7. Click **Install** on the Daze Wallbox card
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/daze/` directory from this repository into your Home Assistant `custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services**
2. Click **Add integration** and search for **Daze Wallbox**
3. Choose your authentication method:

    - **Email & Password** — log in with your Daze account credentials (Cognito)
    - **Access Token & Refresh Token (Advanced)** — use tokens from the Daze web portal ([webportal.dazeservice.com](https://webportal.dazeservice.com)) or the developer console

4. Click **Submit** — the integration validates your credentials
5. Select your **network** (installation location) from the list
6. Review the confirmation screen with your wallbox details and give your device a name
7. Click **Submit** to complete setup

The wallbox should now appear as a single device with all sensors and controls grouped under it.

### Re-authentication

If your tokens expire (token method) or your session times out (email/password method), the integration will automatically prompt you to re-authenticate through the HA UI. You'll be routed to the same authentication method you used during initial setup.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Stop Daze charging during peak hours"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "17:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: switch.daze_charge_control

        data:
          current: 16000
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid tokens" during setup

Make sure you've copied the full access token and refresh token — they are long strings. Tokens must be active (not expired). Obtain fresh tokens from the Daze web portal.

### Integration shows "unavailable"

- Check your internet connection — the Daze API is cloud-based
- Verify your wallbox is online (check the Daze mobile app)
- The integration automatically retries; entities become available again once the API responds

### Re-authentication required

If your refresh token has expired, the integration will trigger a re-authentication flow. Follow the prompts in **Settings → Devices & services** to enter new tokens.

### No data or stale data

- The integration polls every 30 seconds by default
- If the Daze API returns errors, the coordinator retries automatically
- Check the Home Assistant logs for Daze-related error messages

### Sensors not updating after a control command

The integration automatically refreshes data after sending a start/stop/current command. If values don't update, wait for the next scheduled poll cycle.
